# Raytracerâ€”http://staceytay.com/raytracer/

A simple ray tracer built with [GPU.js](http://gpu.rocks/). Read about how I came to build this at http://staceytay.com/2016/04/20/a-parallelized-ray-tracer-in-the-browser.html.

## Setup

```
stacey@Staceys-MBP ~/R/raytracer (master)> tsc
stacey@Staceys-MBP ~/R/raytracer (master)> open index.html
```
